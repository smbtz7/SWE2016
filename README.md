Welcome to Software Sharks! We are currently developing a prototype for scheduling workers in a restuant.  Personally, I (Jeremy) have worked in a resturant since I was legally able to.  During my time in the resturant industry I noticed one of the most time consuming duties for management was creating the weekly schedule.  Who is available when? Who requests off when? When is each employees availble in time? Long story short, ITS A MESS TO DO THIS BY HAND! Yes, there are other peices of software out there, lets say Hot Schedule for example, that already have successfully created this software.  Yet, Hot Scheudles is rather expensive for the employeer.  In order to understand more behind the reason of the price Hot Schedule charges, the Software Sharkes decided to take a look into what goes on while creating a scheduling application and to get more insight as to why these other apps already on the market are so damn expensive. So lets get this started!
